## Basic classification: Classify images of clothing

Trains a neural network model to classify images of clothing, like sneakers and shirts. Uses the [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset, as imported directly from TensorFlow.

This guide uses [tf.keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras), a high-level API to build and train models in TensorFlow.
